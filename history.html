        <h1 class="hisTitle">History Of AI</h1>

        <div class="history">
            <p>During the Second World War, noted British computer scientist Alan Turing worked to crack the ‘Enigma’
                code which was used by German forces to send messages securely.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> <b>Alan Turing</b> and his team created the Bombe machine that was used to decipher Enigma’s messages.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Enigma and Bombe Machines laid the foundations for Machine Learning.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>According to Turing, a machine that could converse with humans without the humans knowing that it is a
                machine would win the “imitation game” and could be said to be “intelligent”.

        <h1>Getting Serious About AI Research</h1>
        <div class="serious">
            <p>In 1951, an machine known as Ferranti Mark 1 successfully used an algorithm to master checkers</p>
            <p>Newell and Simon developed General Problem Solver algorithm to solve mathematical problems</p>
            <p>Also in the 50s John McCarthy, often known as the father of AI, developed the LISP programming language
                which became important in machine learning.
            </p>
            <p>In the late 1960s, computer scientists worked on Machine Vision Learning and developing machine learning
                in robots. 
            </p>
            <p>WABOT-1, the first ‘intelligent’ humanoid robot, was built in Japan in 1972.

        <h1 style="margin-left: 10px;">AI Winters</h1>
        <div class="aiWinter">
            <p>To be successful, AI applications (such as vision learning) required the processing of enormous amount of
                data. Computers were not well-developed enough to process such a large magnitude of data. 
            </p>
            <p>Computer scientists found it incredibly difficult to create intelligence in machines. Hence, Governments
                and corporations were losing faith in AI.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, from the mid 1970s to the mid 1990s, computer scientists dealt with an acute shortage of
                funding for AI research. These years became known as the ‘AI Winters’.
            </p>

        <h1 style="margin-left: 10px;">New Millennium, New Opportunities</h1>
        <br>
        <div class="new">
            <p>In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated became the first computer to beat a reigning world chess champion,
                Garry Kasparov.
            </p>
            <p>Exponential gains in computer processing power and storage ability allowed companies to store vast, and
                crunch, vast quantities of data for the first time</p>
            <p>Machine learning is now embedded in many of the online services we use. In the past 15 years, Amazon,
                Google, Baidu, and others leveraged machine learning to their huge commercial advantage.
