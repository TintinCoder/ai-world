            <h1>Natural Language Understanding</h1>
            <br>
            <p>NLU is a branch of AI that uses computer software to understand input made in the form of sentences in
                text or speech format.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">It enables human-computer interaction</p>
            <p>For example, a request for an island camping trip on Vancouver Island on the 18th of august might break
                down something like this: Ferry tickets [intent] / need: camping lot reservation [intent] / Vancouver
                Island [location] / August 18th [date]</p>

                <p>a clinician can ask a computer to extract a patient's chief complaints from a large data set or
                    unstructured visit notes within an EHR system. Even if the chief complaint is not captured in a
                    specific field in the EHR, NLP has the ability to process all the available data and (with a high
                    degree of accuracy) identify and extract the information.</p>

        <h1>Conversational AI</h1>
        <section id="conversational">
            <p>Converational AI refers to the use of messaging apps, speech-based assistants and chatbots to automate
                communication and create personalized customer experiences at scale</p>
            <h3>Conversational AI is powered by natural language processing (NLP)</h3>

            <h2>Easy Access To Better Care</h2>

                <p style="margin-right: 28px;">Provides access to health care professionals around the clock. When they
                    first need help, patients will be able to schedule a doctor's appointment using a virtual assistant.
                    Patients can send their providers pictures of a troubling skin condition or a note inquiring about
                    potential medication side effects</p>
                <br>
                <p>A conversational AI system starts with a question and then routes the customer to the right answer or
                    solution, eliminating the wait and frustration. It's almost no different than talking to an
                    empathetic person</p>

            <h1>Computer Vision</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Computer Vision deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital
                images or videos</p>
            <br>
            <p>Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital
                images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or
                symbolic information</p>
            <br>
            <p>They can analyse and understand an image</p>

            <h1>Deep Learning</h1>
            <p>It is an artificial intelligence function that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing
                data and creating patterns for use in decision making</p>
            <br>
            <p>It has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabelled. Also known
                as deep neural learning or deep neural network.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Deep learning learns from vast amounts of unstructured data that could normally take humans decades to
                understand and process</p>
        </section>

        <section id="ml">
            <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
            <br>
            <p>It is an application of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from
                experience without being explicitly programmed</p>
            <p>Focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves</p>
            <p>Machine learning is the concept that a computer program can learn and adapt to new data without human
                interference</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Example: </h3>
            <br>
            <p>If a digital payments company wanted to detect the occurrence or potential for fraud in its system, it
                could employ machine learning tools for this purpose. The computational algorithm built into a computer
                model will process all transactions happening on the digital platform, find patterns in the data set and
                point out any anomaly detected by the pattern</p>

        <section id="rpa">
            <h1>Robotic Process Automation</h1>
            <br>
            <p>It is the use of software with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities to handle
                high-volume, repeatable tasks that previously required humans to perform. These tasks can include
                queries, calculations and maintenance of records and transactions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>RPA technology consists of software robots (bots) that can mimic a human worker. RPA bots can log into
                applications, enter data, calculate and complete tasks and then log out.</p>
            <p>Currently, practitioners divide RPA technologies into three broad categories: probots, knowbots and
                chatbots.</p>
            <br>
            <ul class="def">
                <li>1. Probots are bots that follow simple, repeatable rules to process data</li>
                <li>2. Knowbots are bots that search the internet to gather and store user-specified information</li>
                <li>3. Chatbots are virtual agents who can respond to customer queries in real time</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h1>Example in Healtcare</h1>
            <p>Improves healthcare quality: RPA can provide analysis and data from a patient’s condition and their
                progression. It can monitor one’s journey starting from when they began to show symptoms to their
                current condition, offering a smart diagnosis and options for treatment</p>
