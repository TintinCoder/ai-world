    <h1>Healthcare Applications</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>1. Personal health virtual assistant: </h2>
    <p>With most of today's U.S. adolescents, adults and seniors owning a smartphone, they are likely to have access to an intelligent personal virtual assistant on their device. Healthcare apps can be used to deliver medication alerts, patient education material and human-like interactions to gauge a patient's current mental state. The application of AI in the form of a personal assistant can have an incredible impact on monitoring and assisting patients with some of their needs when clinical personnel are not available.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>2. Medical imaging analysis and diagnosis assistance: </h2>
    <p>One of the most valuable uses of AI in healthcare is in radiology. It can assist in the diagnostic processes by analysing many of the medical images such as MRIs, X-rays and CT scans and providing feedback on what it can detect that the human eye may miss.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>3.  Dictation assistance with NLP: </h2>
    <p>NLP has been introduced recently is around the analysis of existing clinical documentation. Modern NLP systems are able to sort through the existing content of the charts and highlight the relevant data for the clinical team.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>4. For drug discovery, development and regulatory challenges: </h2>
    <p>Currently, some pharma majors using AI solutions to filter out difficult-to-find molecules in the drug discovery phases to expedite the development of treatments in a number of therapeutic areas. It could result in significantly shorten development times and brings down the prices – as screenings will be mainly substituted by super computer and prognosticative algorithms or models.</p>
